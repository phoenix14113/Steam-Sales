      <p>
        This website is designed to cater to the friendly gamers out there who are also frugal. We all know the feeling
        of looking at a game that we want to play with our friend and saying "Phew! That is way too expensive!". The
        patient gamer will just wait until the game is on sale before buying it. Putting a game on your Steam wishlist
        is an easy process, but the games that your friends own are something that constantly expanding. Not only this
        but you have to click in and go to the store page for each item your friend owns. Then you might be tempted to
        get something that is not on sale.

      <h2>Website Overview</h2>
      <img id="controller" src="./img//clipart2078827.png" alt="controller picture" />
      <p>The general idea for this website is to display discounted games from your Steam library. Steam doesn't have an
        incredible way of showing you what is on sale at any given moment. You have to manually search for a game or
        just find it on the friend's page and click on each game manually. This takes a lot of time because you have to
        search for them each individually, go to their page, and then back to the home page or your friend's page for
        another search. This makes it a lot easier to spend money because you have to look at all of the games, including
        the ones not on sale, to analyze your friend's games.</p>
      <p>There are currently very few or no websites that specifically collect sales data from your friends on Steam and
        show it in an organized fashion. Some websites show you discounts but make you buy them on their
        website, and some websites just sell game keys at lower rates, but none that I can see link you back
        to the original website that made the sale in the first place. Not having to go through a third-party
        payment method would be extremely useful and probably save people money.</p>

        <h2>About the Sales Table</h2>
        <p>This table uses an API to collect people's Steam libraries, and then pick out only the ones on sale for your
          viewing pleasure. Unlike other websites, I will not show you any other categories other than Steam sales. I
          will show you the header picture for the game, its name, the current price, and how much it is on discount.
          No full-priced games and no filtering results. This is purely designed as a way to browse games currently
          on sale. The only order to the games is that of collecting all of the sales games from the API. I hope this
          feels more like a randomized viewing experience than one organized and designed to show you the most popular
          items. Go to the
          <a href="./GamesTable.html">"<u>Sales table</u>"</a> tab to view this table of sales games.

        <h2>Why This Table</h2>
        <p>You should use this site if you are just wanting to browse a friend's games that are on sale. There are no
          extra parameters to this part of the website. There is only one text field to enter data for your SteamID,
          nothing else to clutter the page. This site is for people who want a simple website and nothing else.
          Enjoy scrolling with out pop-out windows, ads, auto-play videos, or any other kind of distractions.</p>
