  <p>This is a page showing information about myself. I will put my email contact information, and a
    short description of who I are. I'm a computer science student and Walla Walla University. I have
    been in love with computers ever since I was a child. I started off with lego robotics in school
    and enjoyed the challenge of creating instructions for the robot the most. So, when I discovered
    programming in high school I immediately fell in love with it. I did some basic classes over the
    summer and decided that I wanted to learn more. I went to Walla Walla University and enrolled in
    their computer science program. You can look at my <a id="github" href="https://github.com/phoenix14113">github webpage</a>
    to see some of the projects I have worked on. When you look at my repositories make sure you check
    for repositories with published github pages. I was good enough in my math and computer science classes
    that I got hired as a tutor and have been helping other students overcome their challenges and learn
    important computer science problem solving skills. I also got hired as a TA by one computer science
    teachers. He also hired me to help him with his personal project of a Python interpreter in Smalltalk.
    If you would like to see this project please contact me with the email below as it is a private repo.</p>

  <p>Now, a little bit about why this project was important to me. I am a computer science major and love
    gaming. That's why I picked a project relating to Steam, the for most gaming vendor and platform on desktop.
    Since their user interface can be a bit unintuitive I wanted to make something that could help me see in just
    a few moments what games are on sale Hopefully this website will be able to help some of you out there in your
    efforts to have a good time and maybe save you some money in the process. This was originally a team effort with
    two of my colleagues but I decided to strip out my work on the project so I could have a better demonstration
    of my skills. I also launched this on github pages so it is easier to show to prospective employers.</p>
