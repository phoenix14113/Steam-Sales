  <p>
    This is a page showing information about myself. I will put my email contact information, and a
    short description of who I are.</p>

  <p>But first a little bit about the project. I am a computer science major and love gaming. That's why I
    picked a project relating to Steam, the for most gaming vendor and platform on desktop. Since their user
    interface can be a bit unintuitive I wanted to make something that could help me see in just a few moments
    what games are on sale Hopefully this website will be able to help some of you out there in your efforts
    to have a good time and maybe save you some money in the process. This was originally a team effort with
    two of my colleagues but I decided to strip out my work on the project so I could have a better demonstration
    of my skills. I also launched this on github pages so it is easier to show to prospective employers.</p>
