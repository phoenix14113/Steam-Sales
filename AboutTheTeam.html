  <p>I will put my email contact information and a
    short description of who I am. I'm a computer science student at Walla Walla University. I have
    been in love with computers ever since I was a kid. I started with Lego robotics in school
    and enjoyed the challenge of creating instructions for robots the most. So, when I discovered
    programming in high school I immediately fell in love with it. I did some basic classes over the
    summer and decided that I wanted to learn more. I went to Walla Walla University and enrolled in
    their computer science program. You can look at my <a id="github" href="https://github.com/phoenix14113">GitHub webpage</a>
    to see some of the projects I have worked on. When you look at my repositories make sure you check
    for repositories with a published GitHub pages. I was proficient in my math and computer science classes.
    So much so, that I got hired as a tutor and have been helping other students overcome their challenges;
    including helping them learn important computer science problem-solving skills. In addition to tutoring,
    I was also hired by one of my computer science
    teachers, James Foster, as a teacher's assistant. In this job, I helped create computer science homework
    assignments and quizzes. He also hired me to help him with his research project: a Python interpreter in Smalltalk.
    If you would like to see this project please contact me with the email below, as it is a private repo.</p>

  <p>I am a computer science major and love gaming. I picked a project relating to Steam because it is the foremost
    gaming vendor and platform on desktop. Their user interface can be a bit unintuitive. To help with that, I wanted
    to make a program that could help their inefficiency. This program helps you see, in just a few moments, what
    games your friends have that are on sale.</p>
